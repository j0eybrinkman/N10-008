## PDU (Protocol Data Unit)

- Transmission units
    - A different group of data at different OSI layers
- Ethernet operates on a frame of data
    - It doesn't care what's inside    
- IP operates on a packet of data
    - Inside is TCP or UDP, but IP doesn't really care

## TCP or UDP
- TCP segment
- UDP datagram

## Data Encapsulation

## Data Decapsulation

## Dissecting a Frame
 - Each layer has a header and payload

## TCP Flags
- The header describes or identifies the payload
    - Here's what you're about to see...
- The TCP header contains important control information
    - Includes a set of bits called TCP flags

[![TCP Flags](/assets/img/TCP_flags.png)](/assets/img/TCP_flags.png)

- The flags control the payload
    - SYN - Synchronize sequence numbers
    - PSH - Push the data to the application without buffering
    - RST - Reset the connection
    - FIN - Last packet from the sender

## Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
- Maximum IP packet to transmit
    - But not fragment

[![TCP Flags](/assets/img/mtu.png)](/assets/img/mtu.png)

- Fragmentation slows things down
    - Losing a fragment loses an entire packet
    - Requires overhead along the path
- Difficult to know the MTU all the way through the path
    - Automated methods are often inaccurate
    - Especially when ICMP is filtered

## Building an Ethernet Frame

## What is IP Fragmentation?

[![IP Fragmentation](/assets/img/ip_fragmentation.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/PDU_Fragmentation-en.png){:target="_blank"}

- Fragments are always in multiples of 8 because the number of fragmentation offsets bits in the IP header

## Troubleshooting MTU
- MTU sizes are usually configured once
    - Based on the network infrastructure and don't change often
- A significant concern for tunneled traffic
    - The tunnel may be smaller than your local Ethernet segment
- What if you send packets with Don't Fragment (DF) set?
    - Routers will respond back and tell you to fragment
    - Hope you get the ICMP message!
- Troubleshoot using ping
    - Ping with DF and force a maximum size 1472 bytes 
        - 1500 bytes - 8 byte ICMP header - 20 bytes IP address = 1472
            - Windows: `ping -f -l 1472 1.1.1.1`
            - Linux and macOS: `ping -D -s 1472 1.1.1.1 -c4`
