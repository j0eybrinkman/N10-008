## Satellite Networking
- Communication to a satellite
    - Non-terrestrial communication
- High cost relative to terrestrial networking
    - 50 Mbit/s down, 3 Mbit/s up are common
    - Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites
- High latency
    - 250ms up, 250ms down
- High frequencies - 2 GHz
    - Line of sight, rain fade

## Copper
- Extensive installations
    - Relatively inexpensive
    - Easy to install and maintain
- Limited bandwidth availability
    - Physics limits electrical signals through copper
- Wide area networks
    - Cable modem, DSL
- Often combined with fiber
    - Copper on the local loop, fiber in the backbone

## DSL
- ADSL (Asymmettric Digital Subscriber Line)
    - Uses telephone lines
- Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)
    - ~10,000 foot limitation from the central office (CO)
    - 200 Mbit/s downstream / 20 Mbit/s upstream are common
    - Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO

## Cable Broadband
- Transmission across multiple frequencies
- Different traffic types
- Data on the "cable" network
    - DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)
- High-speed networking
    - 50 Mbit/s through 1000+ Mbit/s are common

## Fiber
- High speed data communication
    - Frequencies of light
- Higher installation cost than copper
    - Equipment is more costly
    - More difficult to repair
    - Communicate over long distances
- Large installation in the WAN core
    - Supports very high data rates
    - SONET, wavelength division multiplexing
- Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
    - Business and home use

## Metro Ethernet
- Metro-E
    - Metropolitan-area network
    - A contained regional area
- Connect your sites with Ethernet
    - A common standard
- The provider network is optical
    - Local fiber network
    - Wavelength-division multiplexing
    - High speed, multiple wavelengths of light
